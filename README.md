[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection/blob/main/fraud_detection.ipynb)

An advanced fraud detection system comparing genetic algorithm feature selection against traditional methods, achieving optimal performance with XGBoost classifier.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Genetic Algorithm** for intelligent feature selection
- Comparison with SelectKBest and RFE methods
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Comprehensive performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- Interactive visualizations of results
